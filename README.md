ðŸ“¦ NODE.TS - Crawl and parse links in sitemap recursively.

## Disclaimer

> âš  NOTICE: This project was initially created by https://github.com/gijo-varghese

I restored using the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sitemap-links), I don't use the version that is in npm because it doesn't support TypeScript. I couldn't propose any kind of change, because the [original project](https://github.com/gijo-varghese/sitemap-links) was removed for some reason from GitHub, the original license was ISC, but if you are the author and want to remove this project, just [contact me](mailto:bruno3dcontato@gmail.com) by email.
